Simple prototype lan game project from GameDev.tv Unreal Multiplayer Master: Video Game Dev In C++ Course.

There's a main menu implemented with host/join/quit options allowing to host a game via local network, join a local server by typing the ip address and quit the game. By all means hamachi or other similiar software can be used to simulate lan. The game prototype itself is really basic - standing on the pressure plates allow the movement of platforms.
